# Introduction

üí∏ Don-Jo allows creators to receive support through Ethereum, a popular cryptocurrency, making it easy and secure for supporters to contribute.

ü§ù Our platform utilizes smart contracts to manage donations, ensuring transparency and trust in the donation process for both creators and supporters.

üíÖ Creators can generate unique buttons and QR codes to embed in their SNS posts, making it simple for supporters to donate with just a click or scan.

üßê Creators have access to a user-friendly dashboard, where they can track donations received, total amounts, and other relevant information to help manage their finances.

üí• Instead of just receiving monetary donations, creators can offer supporters the option to choose from various emoji-based items like coffee, pizza, etc., allowing them to set a specific price per item and add a personal touch to the donation experience.
